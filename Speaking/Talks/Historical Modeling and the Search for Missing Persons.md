## Abstract

Over 600,000 people go missing every year in the Unites States alone. Most are located - safe and scared - and reunited with their families within 48 hours, but tens of thousands remain unaccounted for a year later.

The most effective solution to this silent mass disaster has been labor-intensive investigation by law enforcement professionals, volunteers, scientists, and a small group of specialists who collect and vet their information. In 2016, I had the privilege of working with this group of specialists on their information management systems.

We found that the most important aspect of information management is history.

-   Where did this information come from?
-   When was it collected?
-   What else was known at the time?
-   What old information did that new finding replace?

If information is found to be unreliable, the entire chain of inference needs to be reexamined.

We used a technique called Historical Modeling to capture the causal relationships among the various pieces of information. Each data point that came in was tagged not only with the source and time, but also with the list of predecessors: what information was already known to them, and what information are they replacing. We captured these data points as historical facts. No records were ever updated, altered, or deleted. The entire history of every case was preserved in a directed acyclic graph pointing back in time.

A team of specialists must approve every change that an officer, professional, or volunteer enters. This chain of approvals is overlaid on the graph of history to ensure that no tainted information appears on the case. It influences the data that is indexed for search, so that only vetted information is available to the public. It controlled who can see the information: you see your own unapproved edits, but no one else does. And it helped resolve conflicts as different individuals make separate but parallel edits.

With historical modeling, this team is able to find the missing, reunite families, and bring closure to those who have lost loved ones. Learn how to bring these same techniques to bear upon your information management problems.
